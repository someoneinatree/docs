# Working Priorities

## Stack

Helpful for: debugging "don't know what i'm supposed to be doing & unsure why" feeling / productivity bottlenecks

* Focus
   * Physical comfort
   * Basic needs
   * Non-distracting environment
* Computer setup
   * Workflow (internet connection, hardware)
* Knowledge
   * Project status
      * Up-to-date with progress board
   * Task status
      * Up-to-date with personal Work in Progress
* People dependent on me
   * Project / team responsibilities
      * E.g. code review
* Depending on other people
* Flow
   * And now... we code

## Pointers

Problem: how to remember what I'm currently doing? Or, which (multiple) threads am I juggling and at which point in these am I?

Computer (windows, desktop) cannot be fully trusted - Windows is not designed anywhere near that well.

## Priorities

## WORKFLOW improvements

* dev directory with extra layer between it and git repos (e.g today, inactive, reference, personal) categorizing the broad "why" of that project
